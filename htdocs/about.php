	<h2> Why Another One of These Sites?!?!</h2>
	
		<p>
			Yes, these sites are a dime a dozen, but this is primarily an exercise for myself to get a grasp on some development processes and have a chance to build an environment just the way I'd like to interact with one. There will be many  changes, functionally and visually, throughout this process. Expect bugs galore. Feel free to give your input for ideas, report bugs, give your opinion of the site, or even just say "hi" in the comments below. If you find yourself here and want to stick around, even better! Sign up!
